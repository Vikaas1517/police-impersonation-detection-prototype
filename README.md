Police Impersonation Detection Prototype

This repository contains a proof-of-concept decision-support system designed
to assist law enforcement agencies in identifying and prioritizing fake or
impersonated online profiles.

The system analyzes observable profile attributes such as name similarity,
profile image reuse, and account behavior anomalies to generate an explainable
risk score.

Key Characteristics:
- Decision-support only (no automated enforcement)
- Explainable and auditable scoring
- Privacy-preserving and ethical design
- Lightweight and deployable prototype

Ethical Notice:
This prototype uses synthetic and consented data only.
No live social media scraping is performed.
Final decisions remain with law enforcement officers.
